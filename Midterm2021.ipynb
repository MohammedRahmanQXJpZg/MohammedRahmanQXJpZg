A faster method is to keep the input an integer and repeatedly divide by 10, taking the ones digit each time. Towards  this, the following operations might be helpful: `//` is integer division, `n // d` divides `n` by `d` *ignoring* and remainder. `%` is, of course, the mod operation that produces the remainder."
